<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Khushbu Talaviya, a dedicated web developer with a passion for creating dynamic and responsive websites. I specialize in front-end and back-end development, focusing on delivering user-friendly and visually appealing designs. With a strong foundation in programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Node.js, I love bringing creative ideas to life through clean and efficient code.</p>

<p>I am always eager to learn new technologies and keep up with the latest trends in web development. Whether I'm working on personal projects or collaborating with a team, I strive to build websites that offer a seamless user experience. Outside of coding, I enjoy painting and sharing my work with others, which fuels my creativity and attention to detail in web design.</p>
